# DO - Diamond Offshore

### Thesis
DO should benefit from rising floater day rates and inflection in offshore. They own 4 drillships, 9 semisubs (3 are cold-stacked) and have about ~200m in net debt.  

Their contract backlog mostly rolls off towards end of 2023, but after that they could generate $500m-800m+ in mid/peak-cycle EBITDA. They are currently FCF negative but that will change soon. 

They are trading well below fleet replacement value of ~$2B (conservative estimate).

I think it's likely they get bought -- expect a wave of consolidation across the offshore sector. 

### Risks
1. Balance sheet is not 100% clean, still have decent amt of debt. 
2. Just coming out of bankrupcty -- may be a few more waves of forced selling from creditors, though I feel this is unlikely. 
3. Uncertain about how DO will allocate capital. Last cycle, offshore drillers blew capital on new ships at the top -- though I think they will have a tougher time building rigs (again, ESG), I don't trust their capital allocation especially since they are just coming out of bankruptcy...

### Other Thoughts
- Solid exposure to a quality deepwater fleet here - can it effectively hedge jackup exposure when buying VAL?
- The warrants are expensive - is that a leading indicator of price action?
