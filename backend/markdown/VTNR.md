# VTNR - Vertex Energy

### Thesis
VTNR purchased the Mobile refinery from Shell in a forced sale for $75m. The refinery has capacity of 75,000 bpd. Using a $20,000-25,000/barrel price, the refinery is worth somewhere between $1.5-2B. VTNR's current market cap is $1B and it is net cash. Mobile + clean B/S provides decent downside protection.

1. Refineries are scarce assets. Refineries are already running at ATH utilization rates. Nobody wants to build them because of ESG and reopening refineries is a complex process -- supply constraints will likely continue while demand stays steady absent a recession. ESG induced supply deficits: this is the 2020's playbook. 

2. VTNR trades at a cheap multiple relative to other refiners - 3-4x earnings vs 8-10x for most competitors. Multiple re-rate implies an immediate 2-3x bagger. 

3. With crack spreads at ATHs, VTNR is printing cash. FCF yield of 25-30+%. Valuation model assumes crack spreads stay high but start dropping through end of 2023, then revert immediately to 5-yr trailing average. *This isn't a directional bet on crack spreads*

### Risks
Crack spreads could (and likely will) fall through. Biden administration is focused on refineries issue (see [here](https://www.reuters.com/markets/commodities/biden-looking-address-oil-refinery-capacity-white-house-adviser-says-2022-06-10/)), though it's not clear how much the White House can really do. As mentioned above, Mobile refinery should still print decent FCF at lower crack spreads. 

There's always a risk of a natural disaster, especially hurricanes in the GOM -- if that decimates refinery capacity that means crack spreads and utilization stay high, but if it takes out Mobile refinery that's a left-tail risk. 

Technically VTNR share price is overstretched and the stock has high SI. Some have written SI is primarily bondholders hedging. These could cause short-term pain but don't impact core thesis. 

Vertex was a highly asymmetric play at $5-10 but may be less so at $15-20. Proceed with caution.

Note the high volume of ITM/ATM calls being bought on a daily basis. Many suspect this is large instutions building positions on the DL as they start to initiate coverage of VTNR... it's bullish.

Major insider cut stake from $82m to $40m recently. I don't read this as bearish - just taking profits on a solid gain.
