# APRN - Blue Apron Holdings

### Thesis
Blue Apron is a POS company. To borrow from the KEDM discord, APRN nukes capital. They are a capital destruction machine. That said, any asset is a buy if the price is compelling enough. 

APRN's Linden, NJ 500,000 sqft fulfillment facility is probably worth around $75-100 million dollars. APRN also has a large facility at Richmond, CA. On the balance sheet, PPE is $100 million (remember, this is depreciated...). Side note: Linden facility was featured on History Channel's [Modern Marvels](https://www.tvseries.watch/series/modern-marvels/season-20-episode-8-food-inventions-and-innovations)...

APRN also has $25m in net cash. Put these figures together and the liquidation value of the company is at least $100m, but APRN's market cap is closer to $90m. 

### Right Tail
Downside protection established, let's talk about upside potential. I am highly skeptical the following scenarios play out, but if you can get them for free, why not take a position? 

1. Joe Sanberg pulls off a miracle. Blue Apron is Joe Sanberg's *personal passion project*. He has injected tons of capital into the company and believes Blue Apron is a $100+ stock. Recently did a raise at $12/share (Blue Apron shares were trading at $3-4 at the time). Note Sanberg backstopping APRN is another form of downside protection. If Sanberg can shift sentiment on APRN and clear a path forward, it could catalyze a multiple re-rate (APRN is heavily discounted vs peers like Hello Fresh).

2. Food inflation. Interesting thesis point borrowed from Citron research - grocery stores are 3-4 steps separated from producers where as APRN sources direct - means their prices are cheaper. If food prices start getting crazy (which I believe they likely could), could it lead to a resurgence in meal kits? Why buy expensive groceries when you can get legit meals *for cheaper* delivered to your door? 


### Risks
Take a peek at APRN's investor presentation - it will make you audibly groan. Consistent talk of increasing metrics on a per customer basis but no discussion of how they're planning on improving customer retention or acquiring new customers. Misleading metrics all over the place, like lifetime customers out of context (5.3 million customers since inception... but only 350k stuck around?).

You cannot trust this company on fundamentals. You cannot trust them to allocate capital properly. This is a company you buy only if you are very confident there is a lot of downside protection, and even if there is, keep it a small position.
